    "description": "This layer presents land classified as impervious to water infiltration in year 2018. It is derived from a dataset that contains annual change information of global impervious surface area from 1985 to 2018 at a 30m resolution. Change from pervious to impervious was determined using a combined approach of supervised classification and temporal consistency checking. Impervious pixels are defined as above 50% impervious. The dataset is temporally consistent, following the conversion from pervious (e.g., non-urban) to impervious (e.g., urban) monotonically.",
