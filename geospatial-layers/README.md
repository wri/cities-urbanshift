# Objectives

WRI and the UrbanShift regional coordinators engaged with all UrbanShift cities to understand their data-related needs and to identify which data layers are most relevant to each city. 

A data needs survey has been implemented highlighting and allowed the identification of the main data topics to address: `Land cover (e.g., built-up/impervious, vegetation, trees, water)`, `Topography`, `Population density`, `Built-up density`, `Land use (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, vacant, agriculture)`, `Administrative boundaries`, `Amenities/service locations (e.g., jobs, health care, recreation)`, `Roads`, `Transit stops and transportation network`, `Buildings and other infrastructure`, `Emissions of air pollutants`, and `Natural hazards`.

Three main outputs will be delivered as part of this project:

- **Data Catalog**: A list referencing the available geospatial datasets regarding the identified themes and collected with respect to the boundaries of UrbanShift cities.
- **Geospatial Data Portal**: A data portal providing access to the collected and processed layers with the respective metadata and information describing these layers.
- **Data explorer**: A web application for visualizing the different geospatial layers for each UrbanShift city.
