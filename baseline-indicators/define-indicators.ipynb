Connectivity of habitat patches mitigates the effects of habitat fragmentation by allowing animals to access more habitat without having to cross inhospitable terrain. The fragmentation of natural areas affects different species differently. For example, a road might not be a barrier for birds but it can seriously fragment a population of arboreal primates. While consideration of dispersal ability and habitat requirements are important in the management of particular species, the Singapore Index adopts a generalist approach to quantifying connectivity based purely on patch geometry.

We therefore provide diversity data on the three indicator taxa chosen by the Singapore Index as proxies for overall biodiversity: birds, arthropods, and vascular plants. Vascular plants (subkingdom Tracheophyta) are plants with vascular tissues, which conduct water, minerals, and the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. In contrast to nonvascular plants (for example, the mosses), vascular plants can grow tall and in locations with little moisture on the surface of the soil. Vascular plants include more than 90% of the earth’s vegetation. The Singapore Index recommends reporting the number of native species in each of these groups in regular time intervals. A local data-collection process would typically involve partnering with a local research institution to carry out a species survey. This survey would be repeated every few years; the indicator is the change in time from a baseline level to the current year. Here we provide baseline species counts estimated from crowdsourced species-occurrence datasets, but this method has several important limitations. Biologists often interpret species-survey data by examining the number of species found as a function of effort, plotted as a species-accumulation curves (SAC). The SAC plots the cumulative number of species recorded as a function of sampling effort (i.e. number of individuals collected or cumulative number of samples). At the start of a species survey, the total number of species found typically grows quickly with every unit of effort. After some time, however, effort expended yields more and more species that have already been found earlier in the survey—and the total number of species grows more slowly per unit of effort. A plot of species number vs effort will come to a plateau, and this saturation level is a common estimator for the number of species in an area, as shown in Figure 2. The indicators in the Singapore Index are defined as changes in species number over time. Our indicator provides an estimate of species number at one moment in time. It can be applied to estimate a baseline and applied again in later years to estimate the change over time. ',\n",

Only species’ observations with enough data to generate species-saturation curves are considered for estimating species’ richness. We use the SAC curve-fitting approach because it is impossible to conduct an exhaustive survey of all species present even in the indicator taxa. However, our reliance on crowdsourced species observations introduces serious limitations, mostly stemming from an inherent bias toward observations in heavily populated or frequently visited locations. Note also that the Singapore Index Indicators 4-6 require calculation of changes in species number. Our species-number estimates are based on the most recent five full years of observation data, and data from more than five years ago are sparser.

We therefore provide diversity data on the three indicator taxa chosen by the Singapore Index as proxies for overall biodiversity: birds, arthropods, and vascular plants. Vascular plants (subkingdom Tracheophyta) are plants with vascular tissues, which conduct water, minerals, and the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. In contrast to nonvascular plants (for example, the mosses), vascular plants can grow tall and in locations with little moisture on the surface of the soil. Vascular plants include more than 90% of the earth’s vegetation. The Singapore Index recommends reporting the number of native species in each of these groups in regular time intervals. A local data-collection process would typically involve partnering with a local research institution to carry out a species survey. This survey would be repeated every few years; the indicator is the change in time from a baseline level to the current year. Here we provide baseline species counts estimated from crowdsourced species-occurrence datasets, but this method has several important limitations. Biologists often interpret species-survey data by examining the number of species found as a function of effort, plotted as a species-accumulation curves (SAC). The SAC plots the cumulative number of species recorded as a function of sampling effort (i.e. number of individuals collected or cumulative number of samples). At the start of a species survey, the total number of species found typically grows quickly with every unit of effort. After some time, however, effort expended yields more and more species that have already been found earlier in the survey—and the total number of species grows more slowly per unit of effort. A plot of species number vs effort will come to a plateau, and this saturation level is a common estimator for the number of species in an area, as shown in Figure 2. The indicators in the Singapore Index are defined as changes in species number over time. Our indicator provides an estimate of species number at one moment in time. It can be applied to estimate a baseline and applied again in later years to estimate the change over time. ',\n",
    "                                                           'methods' : 'We estimated species richness by estimating the saturation level of species-saturation curves using individual crowdsourced observations as our effort unit. The estimated counts are the mean saturation levels of 100 species-saturation curves, each generated by randomizing the order of all research-grade iNaturalist observations of the Aves, Tracheophyta and Arthropoda taxa in the years 2016-2021. Only species’ observations with enough data to generate species-saturation curves are considered for estimating species’ richness. We use the SAC curve-fitting approach because it is impossible to conduct an exhaustive survey of all species present even in the indicator taxa. However, our reliance on crowdsourced species observations introduces serious limitations, mostly stemming from an inherent bias toward observations in heavily populated or frequently visited locations. Note also that the Singapore Index Indicators 4-6 require calculation of changes in species number. Our species-number estimates are based on the most recent five full years of observation data, and data from more than five years ago are sparser. We therefore can only provide baseline species numbers. Calculation of these indicator scores will require revisiting species-number estimation in several years’ time. '}, \n",

Good habitat generally includes multispecies vegetation and enough structural complexity to provide shade and cover from predators.

This indicator supports the area of land restored method. ',\n",

We used the Landsat Analysis Ready Data from Global Land Analysis and Discovery research group at the University of Maryland. We defined habitat as aquatic or non-cropland vegetated classes, and we compared classifications from the years 2000 and 2020. We defined new habitat as pixels that were classified as non-habitat (urban, cropland or bare) in 2000 but as habitat in 2020. For this indicator we calculated (Area of new habitat) ÷ (area of non-habitat in 2000).  Note that this method differs somewhat from what is described in the Singapore Index indicator 7. Our denominator is non-habitat rather than degraded habitat. Our estimate probably underestimates restoration as measured by this indicator. '}, \n",

Good habitat generally includes multispecies vegetation and enough structural complexity to provide shade and cover. The Singapore Index’s Indicator 7 calls on cities either to estimate the area of land restored to “good ecological functioning” or to enumerate the types of habitat restored. This indicator supports the habitat-type enumeration method. ',\n",
    "                                                           'methods' : 'This indicator is calculated by the formula (Number of habitat types restored) ÷ (number of habitat types in the city in baseline year). The Landsat Analysis Ready Data allows discernment of six land-cover classes which we include as types of habitat: short vegetation, forest, tall forest (taller than 20m), wetland with short vegetation, wetland forest, and open water. (We treated the classes for bare ground, snow or ice, cropland, and built-up area as non-habitat.) We calculate our indicator by (1) identifying areas of new habitat, where habitat existed in 2020 but not in 2000; (2) counting the number of habitat types (i.e., aquatic and vegetated land-cover classes) in these areas of new habitat; and (3) comparing this number to the total number of habitat types in the city in 2020. For example, consider in a city that has four types of habitat in 2020. We look for all habitat areas in 2020 that were nonhabitat in the baseline year 2000, and consider these to be new-habitat areas. Note that this indicator does not distinguish between a city that restores many types of habitat and some cities that simply have few habitat types. In a city with six habitat types, restoration of six types of habitat will result in an indicator value of 100%. The indicator is also 100% if a city with just one habitat type restores just one habitat type. Note also that our method differs from that in the Singapore Index: we use new habitat instead of habitat that has been improved from degraded to good ecological function. Cities that have access to local data specifically detailing the extent and status of habitat-restoration projects would probably benefit from calculating the Singapore Index Indicator 7 using that data.

The OpenStreetMap tags used to retrieve these areas are park, nature_reserve, common, playground, pitch, and track in the leisure category and protected_area and national_park in the boundary category. Status as open space or non-open space for each 10-meter pixel of built land are derived using the built-up class from the 2020 ESA WorldCover dataset as a mask (Zanaga et al. 2021; “ESA WorldCover 10m V100” n.d.). Finally, the count of masked pixels of open space divided by the count of all masked pixels is used to calculate the percent of built area that is open space.  There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. Importantly, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowd-sourced dataset with a diverse user community and its completeness, accuracy and standards of use vary considerably. Accuracy within individual studied cities is not precisely known. Some regions lack data on some of their open spaces in OSM, but all cities we have analyzed so far have data on the sites of at least some open spaces. Additionally, use of OSM taxonomic system of tags to categorize features is used differently by different local contributing communities. In selecting the tags used in our methods we considered the most commonly used tags to designate open spaces available for public use (parks, athletic fields, etc.), while attempting to exclude tags used primarily for private, limited access or indeterminate open spaces. However, as the OSM tagging system is not designed to make this distinction, this may result in the exclusion of data on some open spaces that are available for public use as well as inclusion of some non-public open spaces for some cities. Finally, OSM is being constantly edited, potentially improving the relevant data for these cities, so our download of data from one point in time may quickly become outdated. '}, \n",

As a result, spatial distribution of open space across the city and its alignment with the location of population, and its accessibility within walking distance (commonly defined at 400 meters, including in the Singapore Index (Chan et al. 2021)) is a critical indicator to understand how many city residents are well served by open space.

The open space polygons retrieved from OpenStreetMap are buffered by 400 meters to derive recreation catchment areas. The population within those recreation catchment areas is calculated and then converted to percent by dividing that value by the total population of the area of interest.  There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. The limitations of OpenStreetMap data previously described are also relevant to this indicator. Additionally, our approach for calculating access to open space relies on Euclidean distance for simplicity. However, this straight-line measurement is not an accurate characterization of how people travel within cities as it does not account for the orientation of streets or barriers to pedestrian travel. Because of this reality on the ground, in most cases real pedestrian travel of 400 meters will enable access to a smaller area than our methods present. '}, \n",

A neighborhood reduction method using a circular kernel of 400-meter radius is applied to the tree cover layer to calculate the mean percentage tree cover within 400 meters of each 10m pixel in the area of interest. This result is then used to mask the population layer to only include 100m population pixels with an average of at least 10% tree cover within 400 meters. The population of this 100m masked population layer is calculated and then converted to percent by dividing that value by the total population of the area of interest.  There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. Limitations and uncertainty related to the tree cover dataset is described in the methods paper for Trees in Mosaic Landscapes. In the tropics, the dataset was found to have 97 percent user’s accuracy and 96 percent producers accuracy (Brandt et al. 2022).  The limitations previously described related to the use of Euclidean distance are also relevant to this indicator. '}, \n",

The dataset provides estimates of emissions from 12 sectors of human activity, on a 0.1-degree (approx. 11 km) spatial resolution. The estimates are based on simulations and historical data. The included sectors are: agriculture (livestock); agriculture (soils); agriculture (waste burning); power generation; fugitive emissions; industry; combustion in residential, commercial, and other settings; ships; solvents; solid waste and wastewater; off-road transportation; and on-road transportation.  We used Google Earth Engine for spatial subsetting against cities’ administrative boundaries. We report annual, sector-disaggregated emissions for the years 2000 and 2020, of the each pollutant species. We report all emissions as tonnes/year. We also provide summaries of total emissions for 2000 and 2020. In order to have a shared unit of measurement for all species of emissions, we convert tonnes to CO2 equivalent (CO2 e) based on the 20-year global warming potentials (GWP)'}, \n",

This 30-meter resolution data layer provides an estimate of total carbon flux from trees from the years 2001 through 2021 inclusive in units of Mg CO2e/hectare. To calculate the mean annual carbon flux for each area of interest, we first unmask the dataset so pixels where the dataset shows no carbon flux are given a value of zero and included in subsequent calculations, calculate the mean for the area, and divide the resulting value by 21 to annualize the 21 year dataset. The resulting value estimates the average carbon emissions or removals per hectare from the area of interest during each year in the 21-year period. Negative numbers represent greenhouse gas removals and positive values indicate emissions. There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. The carbon flux model used for the calculations was designed for forests and is based on tree cover as detected by Landsat; it does not pick up or measure carbon flux from sparse tree cover. At 30-meter resolution, Landsat and products developed from it do not pick up isolated trees. Additionally, the model is limited to pixels with tree canopy density >30% and trees of >5 meter height in 2000 or subsequent tree cover gain, so low density or short tree cover is not included.
