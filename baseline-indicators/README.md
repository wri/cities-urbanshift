# Objectives

The baseline indicators attempt to provide insightful metrics at the city scale by addressing three main themes: green space and land restoration, biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. Those indicators are computed based on available open global datasets and hence replicable for all UrbanShift cities.
