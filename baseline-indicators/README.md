# Objectives

The baseline indicators attempt to provide insightful metrics at the city scale by addressing three main themes: green space and land restoration, biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. Those indicators are computed based on available open global datasets and hence replicable for all UrbanShift cities.

# Methodology

## Land degradation & greenspace

| Indicator name | Description | Used datasets | Years |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| Percent of vegetation land based on Dynamic World land cover classes | Percent of land that is trees/water/grass/Scrub/flooded vegetation land cover | Dynamic World Land cover | [2016,2020] |
| Percent of vegetation land based on NDVI threshold | Percent of land that is vegetation (NDVI threshold > 0.4) | Sentinel-2 | [2016,2020] |
| Percent of land with tree cover | Percent of land that has tree cover | Tree Outside of Forests (TOF) | [2020] |
| Percent of built area with tree cover | Percent of land that has tree cover | Dynamic World Land cover, Tree Outside of Forests (TOF) | [2020] |
| Percent of built area with vegetation | Percent of built area with vegetation based on NDVI threshold | Dynamic World Land cover, Sentinel-2 | [2016,2020] |
| Percent of Intra-Urban land classes | Percent of land based on Urban Land Use classification: `Open space`,`Residential`,`Atomistic`,`Informal subdivision`, `Formal subdivision`,`Housing projects`. | Intra-Urban Land Use | [2020] |
| Percent of tree cover by urban land classes | Percent of tree cover level (as expressed in Tree Outside of Forests dataset) by intra-urbal land use classes | Intra-Urban Land Use, Tree Outside of Forests (TOF) | [2020] |
| Percent of vegetation by urban land classes | Percent of vegetation (based on NDVI threshold) by intra-urbal land use classes | Intra-Urban Land Use, Sentinel-2  | [2020] |

## Biodiversity

## GHG emissions
