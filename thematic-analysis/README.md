# Objective

The objective of these thematic analysis consists of providing in depth analysis for a selection of cities by focusing on specific areas of interest based on the most important challenges they are facing.

These analyses aim at providing more specific indicators and reports by combining global geospatial data with local data collected in the ground by our partners cities.

# Freetown case study

Freetown City Council (FCC) identified several potential areas of WRI assistance based on ongoing activities and needs associated with the Freetown Structure Plan and the Mayorâ€™s Transform Freetown plan. The proposed thematic analysis consists of providing FCC with a supervised classification framework to develop simple models for classifying urbanized land in multiple time periods. The framework will provide a starting classification model that can be customized with additional user provided input data to provide improved results. In addition to urban vs non-urban classification, WRI may be able to provide a model framework for classifying multiple types of urban expansion (e.g., infill, sprawl, leapfrogging, etc.).
